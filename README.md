## [Arithmetic Sequence Calculator](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/arithmetic)

Calculates the formulas for an arithmetic sequence given 2 terms. In other words, it calculates a line through 2 points.

These formulas are actually inverse lerp and lerp. [See here for more info!](https://github.com/MysteryPancake/Houdini-Fun/blob/main/Lerp.md)

## [Random Audio Splicer](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/audiosplicer)

Randomly slices up audio into segments and plays the result. Requested by Zoe Kelman (not sponsored)

## [Hair Blower](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/hairblower)

Ultra realistic hair blowing simulation definitely not made in 5 minutes. Better than Vellum in Houdini?

## [Image to UML](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/imagetouml)

Converts an image to a UMLet diagram. It recreates the image using coloured rectangle nodes for each pixel.

## [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/knearestneighbors)

Inspired by my machine learning class at university. Draws the result of running k-nearest neighbors on a few points, which looks like voronoi.

Every pixel is drawn using an individual rectangle, so it's horribly slow. [Use WebGL for good performance.](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MslGD8)
