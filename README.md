### [Arithmetic Sequence Calculator](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/arithmetic)

Calculates the formulas for an arithmetic sequence given 2 terms. In other words, it calculates a line through 2 points.

These formulas are actually inverse lerp and lerp. [See my article here for more info!](https://github.com/MysteryPancake/Houdini-Fun/blob/main/Lerp.md)

### [Random Audio Splicer](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/audiosplicer)

Randomly slices up audio into segments and plays the result. Requested by Zoe (not sponsored)

### [Boolean Comparisons](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/booleancomparisons)

A table of boolean comparisons made for the [Boolean Math node in Blender](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/14f6afb09003903a25872e6b05c67411db5e5267).

I guess I didn't trust myself to get it right, since it's generated in JavaScript.

### [Caleb Fuzz](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/calebfuzz)

The simplest form of audio distortion, designed by Caleb for a guitar pedal. It's just `Math.sign(sample)`.

### [Text Corruption](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/corrupt)

Corrupts [TomJedi9's holy gospel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLvFdsggaNQ) with horrible swear words and profanity. Not safe for work!

<img src="./images/corrupt.png" width="500">

### [CSS Programming](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/cssprogram)

Did you know you can run simple code in CSS? Math totally works, just use `counter-reset`!

### [Cursor Draw](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/cursordraw)

Draws a trail as you move the cursor around the page.

<img src="./images/cursordraw.png" width="500">

### [Cursor Particles](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/cursorparticles)

Spawns star particles as you move the cursor around the page.

<img src="./images/cursorparticles.png" width="500">

### [Cursor Physics](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/cursorphysics)

Spawns bouncing balls as you move the cursor around the page.

<img src="./images/cursorphysics.png" width="500">

### [Cursor Trail](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/cursortrail)

Spawns a trail of stars as you move the cursor around the page.

### [Earrape](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/earrape)

The most beautiful music in the world, make sure to turn up your sound!

<img src="./images/earrape.png" width="500">

### [Fake Login](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/fakelogin)

Faithful recreation of Google Chrome's login popup, great for doing ethical stuff with people's passwords!

<img src="./images/fakelogin.png" width="500">

### [Frog Drawer](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/frogdrawer)

The latest and greatest in frog drawing technology, made for Joseph Tonien's webdev class.

### [Hair Blower](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/hairblower)

Ultra realistic hair blowing simulation definitely not made in 5 minutes. 10/10 better than Vellum in Houdini

<img src="./images/hairblower.png" width="500">

### [Image to UML](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/imagetouml)

Converts an image to a UMLet diagram. It recreates the image using coloured rectangle nodes for each pixel.

<img src="./images/imagetouml.png" width="500">

### [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/knearestneighbors)

Inspired by my machine learning class at university. Draws the result of running k-nearest neighbors on a few points, which looks like voronoi.

Every pixel is drawn using an individual rectangle, so it's horribly slow. [Use WebGL for good performance.](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MslGD8)

<img src="./images/knearestneighbors.png" width="500">

### [Lerp Smoother](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/lerpsmoother)

My old horribly broken method of smoothing with lerp. [For much better methods, see my article here.](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Houdini-Fun/TimeSmoothing)

<img src="./images/lerpsmoother.png" width="500">

### [Porter Trail](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/portertrail)

Trails a point travelling in a random direction, similar to [Porter Robinson's music videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahEovqzpLeU)

This is a form of [simple brownian motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNzoTGv_XiQ).

<img src="./images/portertrail.png" width="500">

### [PowerPoint](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/powerpoint)

End of slide slow, click to exit. Great for trolling teachers.

<img src="./images/powerpoint.png" width="500">

### [Pulse Width Modulation](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/pwm)

Calculates interpolated windows of pulse width modulation, correcting the phase offset between windows.

This was originally designed for Cinema Sense, an app for blind people to experience films through other senses (like vibration).

<img src="./images/pwm.png" width="500">

### [Queue Simulator](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/queuesimulator)

Dumb brute force discrete simulation of a queue of customers, made for a problem solving course at university.

<img src="./images/queuesimulator.png" width="500">

### [Queue Visualiser](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/queuevisualiser)

Smarter continuous simulation of a queue of customers, made for a problem solving course at university.

<img src="./images/queuevisualiser.png" width="500">

### [Raw Audio Player](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/rawaudio)

Plays an audio signal stored as a string of numbers.

<img src="./images/rawaudio.png" width="500">

### [Resampling Demo](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/resamplingdemo)

Draws and plays many signal interpolation methods. I made this for debugging while making an audio plugin.

Sinc is the highest quality option for audio, but also the most expensive.

<img src="./images/resamplingdemo.png" width="500">

### [Resize Calculator](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/resizecalculator)

Calculates how much an image needs to be shrunk to fit under a certain number of megapixels.

I made this since Google Docs has an image size limit of 25 megapixels.

<img src="./images/resizecalculator.png" width="500">

### [Brute Force Sudoku Solver](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/sudoku)

Solves easy and medium Sudoku boards with brute force elimination based on the Sudoku rules.

Made to cheat in daily Sudoku challenges, inspired by Ellen.

<img src="./images/sudoku.png" width="500">

### [UML to Java Converter](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/umltojava)

Converts UML syntax to Java code, filling in constructors, getters and setters where possible using fuzzy matching.

Supports basic syntax like `+`, `-`, `#`, `getVar()`, `changeVar()`, `setVar()`, and variables declared as `type`, `name: type` or `type name`

<img src="./images/umltojava.png" width="500">

Supports some advanced syntax like `<<read only>>`, `{read only}`, `/AbstractClass/`, `<<abstract>>`, `<<interface>>`, `__staticMethod()__`

<img src="./images/umltojava2.png" width="500">

Also has basic support for `<<enumerator>>` and `<<enum>>`:
